Cookies

If you tick “Remember Me”, your login will persist for a fortnight. If you sign out of your account, the sign in cookies will be deleted.

If you edit or publish an article, an additional cookie will be saved in your browser. This cookie includes no personal information and just indicates the post ID of the blog post you just edited. It is removed after 1 day.

Posts on this website may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.

These websites may obtain information about you, use cookies, embed extra third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including analysing your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that site.

Who we share your data with

We do not share information with third parties, however we do place Facebook and/or Google pixels so that we can track the performance of our paid advertising.

This does not give us any personal information, but allows us to make better choices based on the general trend.


How long we retain your personal information

If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are stored indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow up comments automatically instead of keeping them in a moderation queue.

For people that register on our site (if any), we also keep the personal data they give us in their user profile.

All users can see, edit, or erase their personal information at any time (except they cannot change their username).

Website admin can also view and update those details.

If you have a profile on this website, or have left comments (currently turned off), you may request to obtain an exported file of the personal data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us.

You can also request that we erase any private information we hold about you.

This excludes any information we are required to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.
